Requirements/Assumptions for the program

-	The first line of the input will contain two integers, first for left margin and second for right margin. 
-	The other lines will have the text that is supposed to be formatted. 
-	I have assumed that there are total 80 characters maximum per line. 
-	I have assumed that the words in a line are not more than 80 characters.

Algorithm:
1)	Read the first line and get left and right margin. Continue with other lines. 
2)	For other lines, split the line to words. 
3)	Put the left margin and loop through the words. 
4)	Print and write it to the output file with one space between each word until the right margin is reached. 
5)	If there is a period (.) then put two spaces, also update the margin position.
6)	If right margin is achieved, repeat 3 and 4.
7)	If the input file reaches a new line, then print a empty line and write a line break in the output file. It is a new paragraph.
